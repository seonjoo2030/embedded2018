Product management device using ultrasonic sensor

I think that it can be used in the process of packing products produced by using ultrasonic sensors, or in various processes.
First, the distance value is obtained by continuously generating the signal in units of seconds.
At this time, the distance value is calculated for the moving article by the conveyor belt. If the distance value is more than a certain range, or if there is an error, the LED is turned on to notify that there is an error.

If you create a graph with distance in seconds, you can see the shape of the object.
Therefore, it is a system that informs the user when the shape of the object is different, for example, when the object falls over while the object is moving and the shape of the distance is changed by the distance values ​​of the previously stored object.
